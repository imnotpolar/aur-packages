# aur-packages

This is a mirror of the [AUR packages i maintain or co-maintain](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&SeB=M&K=imnotpolar).

# Repository Structure

Each package maintained in this repository has its own branch named aur/<PKGNAME>. For example, the branch for the package hyprpicker-git is aur/hyprpicker-git. All of the original AUR commit history is retained in their respective package branches.


The `main` branch only contains this README.md file and nothing else.

# Co-Maintenance and Adoption

I welcome any contributions to the maintenance of my AUR packages! If you are interested in adopting or co-maintaining a package, please feel free to reach out through any of the following methods:

    AUR Comment: Leave a comment on the package page.
    GitHub Issue: Open an issue in this repository.

I appreciate any help and can add you as a co-maintainer. If you prefer to take full ownership, I can disown the package for you to adopt it. Alternatively, you can submit an orphan request on AUR.

Thank you for your interest in contributing!
